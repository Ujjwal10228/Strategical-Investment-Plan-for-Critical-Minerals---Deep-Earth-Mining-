# Strategical-Investment-Plan-for-Critical-Minerals---Deep-Earth-Mining-

🎯 **Main Task**

Prepare an investment plan optimizing:

1. Location (A, B, C)

2. Depth (0–20 km)

3. Year horizon (5, 10, 15 years)

**Goal**: Maximize cumulative profit over 5, 10, and 15 years.

**Profit = Σ massₘ,ₗ,ₗ × ( priceₘ,ᵧ – ( costₗ,ₗ + refining_costₗ,ₗ ) )**

Where:

**m** → mineral

**l** → location

**d** → depth

**y** → year horizon

Supply-demand constraints:

If extraction exceeds the demand–supply gap, prices fall.

Price remains fixed only if:
demand < new_supply


### Solution

- requirements.txt	Dependencies (pandas, numpy, scipy, matplotlib, seaborn, pulp, openpyxl)
- task1_task2_industry_analysis.ipynb	Mining industry overview + ecological impacts 
- task3_depth_optimization.ipynb	Depth optimization model for all locations 
- task4_mineral_extraction.ipynb	Mineral selection optimization for Location A 
- task5_custom_strategy.ipynb	Custom 15-year strategic investment plan 

### Content Summary
**Task 1 & 2 Notebook**
Mining operations pipeline (Licensing → Exploration → Extraction → Concentration → Refining → Logistics)
Cost drivers analysis with visualizations
6 ecological impacts identified with risk assessment
Mitigation strategies for groundwater, heat/pressure, chemical leakage, and seismic risks

**Task 3 Notebook**
Calculates demand-supply gaps for all minerals
Identifies top 4 minerals by gap size
Computes profit at each depth (0-20km) for Locations A, B, C
Outputs optimal depth per location per horizon (5/10/15 years)

**Task 4 Notebook**
Uses optimal depths from Task 3
Includes additional logistics costs per number of minerals
Greedy optimization to select minerals maximizing profit
Results saved to task4_optimization_results.csv

**Task 5 Notebook**
Phased depth progression strategy
Mineral portfolio diversification (Core/Stable/Growth)
Competitive advantage leveraging with ESG positioning
15-year strategic roadmap visualization


### Our Unique Position
We possess **advanced drilling technology** enabling 20km extraction with minimal ecological impact. This creates strategic options:

1. **Technology Licensing**: License drilling tech to competitors (revenue diversification)
2. **Premium Pricing**: Market minerals as "sustainably extracted" for ESG-conscious buyers
3. **First-Mover Advantage**: Access deeper, richer deposits competitors cannot reach
4. **Vertical Integration**: Control supply chain from extraction to refined product

## Final Strategic Recommendations

### Location A Investment Plan

| Horizon | Depth Strategy | Primary Minerals | Capital Allocation | Risk Profile |
|---------|----------------|------------------|-------------------|--------------|
| **5-Year** | 0-5km | Lithium, Copper | 30% of total | Conservative |
| **10-Year** | 5-12km | Lithium, Cobalt, Nickel | 40% of total | Moderate |
| **15-Year** | 12-20km | Full portfolio + RareEarth | 30% of total | Aggressive |

### Key Success Factors
1. ✅ **Phase investment** to reduce risk and build capabilities
2. ✅ **Focus on EV minerals** (Lithium, Cobalt) for 5-10 year growth
3. ✅ **Expand to Rare Earths** in years 10-15 as prices appreciate
4. ✅ **Leverage ESG positioning** for premium pricing
5. ✅ **Maintain flexibility** to adjust based on market conditions
